## Deployment of Machine Learning Project on Hugging Face Using Streamlit

- This repository contains code for deploying a machine learning model on the Hugging Face model hub using Streamlit. The project aims to showcase how to deploy and share machine learning models easily with the community.

### Overview
- The deployment process involves the following steps:
1. Preparing the Machine Learning Model: Train and save your machine learning model using your preferred framework (e.g., streamlit, streamlit_image_select, tensorflow, numpy, cv2, PIL)
2. Creating a Streamlit Web Application: Develop a Streamlit web application that loads the trained model and allows users to interact with it through an intuitive interface.

### Repository Structure
1. app.py: Streamlit web application code.
2. requirements.txt: File containing required Python packages for running the Streamlit app.
3. README.md: This file.

I just uploaded my machine learning model to the Hugging Face model hub : - "https://huggingface.co/spaces/khushi-kasera/Fake-Job-Posting-Generator"
